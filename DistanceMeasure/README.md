# Distance Measure

This example uses fiducial markers to calculate their distance from the (calibrated)
camera. Also, displays the obligatory Utah Teapot on the marker ;)

A sample calibration file is provided, but it is for my camera! So the results may not
be what you expect. Calibrate the camera yourself through OpenCV.
