# OpenCV + ARToolKit + OpenGL = Augmented Reality Megacombo :)

This is a repository of my experiments with Augmented Reality.

## Requirements

To build the examples you will usually need:

* OpenCV (http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/)
* ARToolKit from Launchpad (https://launchpad.net/artoolkitplus)
* OpenGL + GLUT
* CMake for building (or compile/link it yourself)
